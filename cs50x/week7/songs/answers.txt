Audio Aura Characterization:
High Energy, High Valence, High Danceability: The listener enjoys upbeat, happy, and energetic music suitable for dancing.
Low Energy, High Valence, High Danceability: The listener enjoys positive, danceable music, but not intense or energetic (e.g., relaxed dance music).
High Energy, Low Valence, Low Danceability: The listener enjoys intense or aggressive music with a low mood and less focus on danceability (e.g., high-energy rock).
Low Energy, Low Valence, Low Danceability: The listener prefers subdued, melancholic, introspective music, not meant for dancing.

Why the Aura Calculation Might Not Be Representative:
Over-simplification: Averaging values may miss nuances of a listenerâ€™s varying moods and preferences across different times or activities.
Neglecting Temporal Changes: The aura may not reflect seasonal or time-of-day shifts in music taste.
Lack of Context: Songs might have different meanings or moods based on the context in which they're heard (e.g., exercise vs. relaxation).

Proposed Improvements for the Audio Aura Calculation:
Contextual Analysis:

Time-based Analysis: Analyze preferences during different times (e.g., morning, evening, seasons) for a more dynamic aura.
Listening Activity: Factor in context, like listening to upbeat music during exercise or calming music while reading.
Song Variability: Calculate the variance or standard deviation of energy, valence, and danceability to capture mood fluctuations.

Use of More Metrics: Include additional metrics like tempo, loudness, or speechiness for deeper insight into mood.

Incorporate User Activity: Consider how often a user skips or replays songs to refine their audio aura.

Sentiment Analysis: Analyze lyrics for sentiment (positive or negative) to improve mood characterization.

Machine Learning Approach: Use machine learning to track mood based on comprehensive data (e.g., listening time, skips, replays), providing a more accurate audio aura.
